- 👋 Hi, I’m @Leehelsby
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about coding to potentially change my career. I've been doing quite a bit of research over the last couple of weeks and now I'm here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics of HTML and CSS. I believe if I get the fundamentals down I will have a solid foundation to build off.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of yet. Maybe just get assistance on where to go or what to do next.
- 📫 You could reach me on here if that is doable anyway.

- Thanks for reading, hope you say hi
